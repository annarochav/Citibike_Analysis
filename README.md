Challenge Week14 Data Analysis BootCamp using Tableau and Pandas.

## ⚡Overview of the Project: 

Citi Bike, the biggest bike sharing program in the US, has a lot of data to look 
for, especially for this project, data from August 2019 was examined and 
analyzed using Tableau so Des Moines can take better investment decisions based 
on this data. Several graphs were done, and they show information about the 
length of time that bikes are checked out by gender, number of bike trips for 
each hour of each day of the week etc.

## ⚡Summary: 

Citibike is mostly used by subscribers that need the bike to go to work, we can see it clearly in the traffic on weekdays and the busy neighborhoods. There is also a significant number of tourists that use the bike mostly on weekends, probably are the ones who didn’t specify the gender and tend to use the bikes for 16 min in comparison to 5 min of the subscribers. 
The bikes are mostly used by male subscribers who have rides 5 min long. Citibike has a great opportunity for a marketing campaign to impulse females to use bikes more often. 
Having a bike repair/replacement plan is a must especially for the bikes used in the most popular neighborhoods like Union Square and Hudson Yards. Since rides tend to be very short, it would be a good idea to have analyze the possibility of having more stations. 
The 2 additional visualizations suggested for future analysis would be: 
1.	Compare data for different months not just August to see if trends remain the same.
2.	Analyze where are located the high use bikes to take an action plan for the replacement.
